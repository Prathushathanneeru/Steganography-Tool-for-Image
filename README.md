# Steganography-Tool-for-Image
# Introduction
Steganography, derived from Greek words meaning "covered writing," is the art of hiding information within another medium so that its very presence is concealed. Unlike encryption,which scrambles a message to make it unreadable, steganography hides the message itself toavoid suspicion. Digital image steganography leverages the vast amount of data contained in images to embed secret information without visible alterations to the human eye. This project focuses on implementing a practical steganography tool that encodes text data within common image formats like PNG and BMP by manipulating the least significant bits (LSB) of the image pixels. As digital communication grows, secure and covert transmission of information becomes more critical, making steganography an important technique in information security, digital watermarking, and privacy protection. This project not only demonstrates the fundamental concepts but also provides an accessible user-friendly interface for embedding and extracting hidden text messages.
# Abstract
The project develops a robust Python-based steganography application with a graphical user interface designed for efficient and secure secret message embedding and extraction within digital images. Using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) method, the application modifies the pixel data of images in PNG and BMP formats to hide textual data in a way that is imperceptible to the naked eye or standard image viewers. The GUI, built with Python's Tkinter, features responsive design elements to ensure adaptability to varying window sizes, enhancing usability across devices. Threading enables smooth background execution of intensive operations, maintaining application responsiveness. The project highlights the practical implementation of steganography for covert communication with simplicity, demonstrating how digital files can be used as silent carriers for sensitive data. This tool is valuable for privacy-conscious users and educational purposes within cybersecurity fields.
